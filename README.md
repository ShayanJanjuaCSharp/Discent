# Discent | Future of Blockchain Uni Hackathon 2024
## What is Discent?
Discent is a new social platform, integrated with the blockchain, to provide a community led environment to share skills. The word Discent is derived from Latin meaning, "they will learn", which is key to our objective with this service. We intend to provide a space where experts in fields can share their knowledge to individuals in need.
## Who are we?
We are Prometheus, a team of developers based in the city of London. Our team members currently all study at City, University of London. We are experienced in creating web services, particularly with NextJS.
## How is Blockchain used?
All our courses are safely stored directly onto Citrea. Smart Contracts for our Dapp can be found at https://explorer.testnet.citrea.xyz/address/0xf3D676ebF2Fbfa725292130c13DfEa8FCC79b00f?tab=contract 
## Logging in
If you are using Discent for the first time, you are going to want to log in. To do so, head to the profile page. There you will be able to log in by pressing the log in button. Unfortunately, currently Discent only allows log in via Google, however more ways are soon to come. Simply press Log in and then go through the steps on google and you'll be logged in with us in no time.

## How to create a course.
Discent allows for anyone to create a course, no matter what your skill level, so if you have something you want to share go ahead and share it. To do so, go to the search page where you will find the "Create Course" Button. Clicking on this will open a pop up in which you will be provided all the fields you need to create your own course. The name is the name of the skill you are teaching, and the description is the field where you get to explain what your course does. Once you're done, click the "Add Course" button to add your course into Discent's Network. Well done, you have created your first course.
## Replying to your students.
As a teacher of a course, students will need to learn from you. This is done through the DMs page. The Dms page is much like any other Direct Messaging page of other social media sites. On the left hand side, there is the name of the course you are teaching that person, and on the right, there is the name of the person you are teaching. Click on the conversation you want to talk in and the conversation page will open. In this page, your entire chat history will be visible and a send message field and button can be seen. To send a message, simply write what you want in the text field and then press the send message button.
## Joining Courses
Joining courses is done through the search and home pages. Both pages have a list of all courses that are available. If you see one you like, click the join button at the bottom of that course. This will enlist you into the course, congrats!
## Learning
In much the same way as teaching, learning is also done through the DMs page. Simply click on the DM of the course that you want to learn from, and you will be taken to the conversation page.
